Green Energy Stock Analysis for Steve

### Challenge
After finishing creating our stock analysis tool, we have determined that the DQ Stock was not a viable stock investment for the year 2018 due to it poor stock return of -62.6%. However, it was a good option in the year 2017 giving a return of 199.4%. Looking further into the other stocks that he provided we can see that 2018 was a rough year for many stocks except for ENPH and RUN both giving a return of ~80%. Which could hold a good potential investment option in the future.

We have modified the stock Analysis tool in order to provide Steve & his parents a broader analysis tool for them to use in their future investments. The modifications will let them analysis more than 12 stocks in a click of a button. This feature is still in progress, but having this tool become dynamic to their investment needs will help them make more smarter decisions.
