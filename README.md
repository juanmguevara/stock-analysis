### Challenge
After finishing creating our stock analysis tool, we have determined that the DQ Stock was not a viable stock investment for the year 2018 due to it poor stock return of -62.6%. However, it was a good option in the year 2017 giving a return of 199.4%. Looking further into the other stocks that he provided we can see that 2018 was a rough year for many stocks except for ENPH and RUN both giving a return of ~80%. Which could hold a good potential investment option in the future.
